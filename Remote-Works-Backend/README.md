# things to do
## jwt
Make sure past JWT token are invalidated
Limits how often JWT token can be requested
## Security
Configuring TLS support
Add rate-limiting middleware
(ensure npm dependencies are secure if time permits)

## Code Abstraction
Abstract data from classes middleware and service classes to limit code repetition
